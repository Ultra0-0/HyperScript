# HyperScript
The BEST coding language ecosystem, for only the KEWLEST of kewl people :3 (gatekeeping for a bit)

I'm going to probably update this later with all of the features (there's a lot)

If you're a mad scientist who wants one syntax for everything with infinite customization then THIS is for you!

# How it works
The ecosystem contains one singular core file. This core file (.core) is where you can toggle the environment's configuration settings. Example, if you wanna make a calculator you obviously need it to run on low end hardware. You can toggle off all of the fancy features to give you crazy speed and a light file.

# Perks:
- A customizable compiler
- OOP to ECS translation (for fast speeds)
- Self compiling and self assembly (no C slowing us down.)
- Though it does assemble with its own assembly language, there's different configurations depending on whether you need to make an OS or a website.
- Can cross-compile other languages!
- Built-in deltaTime and event blocks for more control.
- Easy modding support AND support for libraries from OTHER languages! (Get the libraries of python with the speed of C)

# Flaws:
- egg
- Once you are done developing and you toggle the "final compile" to on. The core will not be modifiable.
- I can't think of any U_U
